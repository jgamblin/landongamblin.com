# Landon Gamblin

## Welcome!

Hi, I'm Landon. I love video games and Dungeons & Dragons. This is my website where I learn to code with my dad!

## About Me
I'm a beginner coder, excited to build cool things and share my journey. Some of my favorite video games are [Fortnite](https://www.fortnite.com/), [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/), [Terraria](https://terraria.org/), and [Deltarune](https://deltarune.com/). When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me playing games or rolling dice in a D&D campaign!
